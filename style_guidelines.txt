Overall Look and Feel of UAgenda
===============================

The overall look of the website should be modern. We will be using JavaScript animations (GSAP) to give a better look to the website and make it more interactive for the users.

Colours
========
For UAgenda, colours are inspired from the University of Ottawa colors but include other colors too.

The main color is burgundy which is used for some section and the navigation bar, it is also used in the team's avatars and the logo :
- #8F001A

Background colors for the sections :

- Main section has an image instead of a color (img/calendar-4.jpg)
- #f4f4f4 (Features)
- #f8eacd (Pricing
- #fff (Team)
- #8F001A (Contact Us)

Text color
- #fff
- #000

Button
- 8F001A
- Icons from brands

Iconography
===========
For icons we are using a logo that we designed representing an agenda (img/UAgenda.svg) to fit with the theme of our product as well as icons from social medias and brands (Google Play, App Store, Instagram, Facebook and Gmail)

Typography
==========
We will be using Roboto, Poppins and Montserrat from Google Fonts with the size of 300, 500 and 700 depending on the use case (Titles, paragraphs, subtitles and more)

Links
=====
The navigation bar will be underlined when hovering and them and keeping the last link underlined until the user clicks on another section.

Buttons
=======
Buttons will be simple with the same burgundy color.
